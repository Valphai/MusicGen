# MusicGen
This is a small deep learning project to generate christmas songs, made with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Given the dataset I believe you can generate any genre with this model.

# TODO
Still need to figure out how to play the songs. My first thought is Ipython display, will try to work on this later.

# Dataset
[A Treasury of Christmas Carols: The Hymns and Carols of Christmas](http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/). Over 2,800 Christmas carols and hymns, and over 300 Christmas poems, preserving a rich history of Christmas literature and music which might otherwise be lost.
